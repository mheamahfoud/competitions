# Visual Pollution Detection

This project is based on the YOLOv7 repository by WongKinYiu and aims to detect visual pollution in images.

## Overview

This solution involves training a detector using YOLOv7. The steps covered in this solution include:

- Installation of YOLOv7 dependencies
- Loading and analyzing the dataset
- Splitting the dataset for training and evaluation
- Evaluating YOLOv7 performance

## Dataset Preparation

In this notebook, we download the dataset as a zip file, extract it, and prepare it for training.

## Usage

To use this solution, follow these steps:

1. Install YOLOv7 dependencies.
2. Load and analyze your dataset.
3. Split the dataset for training and evaluation.
4. Evaluate YOLOv7 performance.
